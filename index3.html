    At my age (I was born in 1899), I cannot promise — I cannot even promise myself — more than these few variations on favorite themes. As everyone knows, this is the classic recourse of irreparable monotony. Allow me, nevertheless, to point out one or two details.
  </div>

  <div class="fragment">
    It was in Cambridge, back in February, 1969, that the event took place. I made no attempt to record it at the time, because, fearing for my mind, my initial aim was to forget it.
  </div>

  <div class="fragment">
    Now, some years later, I feel that if I commit it to paper others will read it as a story and, I hope, one day it will become a story for me as well.
  </div>

  <div class="fragment">
    I know it was horrifying while it lasted — and even more so during the sleepless nights that followed — but this does not mean that an account of it will necessarily move anyone else.
  </div>

  <div class="fragment">
    "Quite well. Father makes his same antireligious jokes. Last night he said that Jesus was like the gauchos, who don't like to commit themselves, and that's why he preached in parables." He hesitated and then said, "And you?"
  </div>

  <div class="fragment">
    I realized that to a boy not yet twenty a man of over seventy was almost in the grave. "It often approaches forgetfulness," I said, "but it still finds what it's asked to find. I study Old English, and I am not at the bottom of the class."

  <div class="fragment">
    I have discovered the key. The meeting was real, but the other man was dreaming when he conversed with me, and this explains how he was able to forget me; I conversed with him while awake, and the memory of it still disturbs me.
  </div>

  <div class="fragment">
    Here are the facts. I shall tell them as briefly as I can.
  </div>

  <div class="fragment">
    Don Alejandro Glencoe, the president, was an Uruguayan rancher and owner of a large spread of land bordering on Brazil. His father, a native of Aberdeen, had established himself on this continent around the middle of the last century.
  </div>

  <div class="fragment">
    He brought with him some hundred books — the only books, I venture to say, that don Alejandro read in the course of his life. (I speak of these assorted books, which I have had in my hands, because in one of them lies the root of my story.)
  </div>

  <div class="fragment">
    The elder Mr. Glencoe, on dying, left a daughter and a son. The son was later to become our president; the daughter married an Eguren and was Fermin's mother.
